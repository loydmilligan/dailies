# Project Plan - Dailies Content Curation System

## Project Overview

Dailies is a comprehensive content curation and knowledge management system that addresses the challenge of information overload by intelligently processing, categorizing, and synthesizing digital content into actionable daily digests.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Objective**: Establish core infrastructure and database architecture

**Key Deliverables**:
- Database schema design and implementation
- Basic API framework
- Core content models and data structures
- Development environment setup

### Phase 2: Content Capture (Weeks 3-4)
**Objective**: Enable seamless content bookmarking and metadata extraction

**Key Deliverables**:
- Browser extension for Chrome and Firefox
- Content capture API endpoints
- Metadata extraction pipeline
- Basic web interface for content management

### Phase 3: AI Processing Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
**Objective**: Implement intelligent content classification and analysis

**Key Deliverables**:
- AI integration with Gemini API
- Content classification system (Politics/General)
- Political content analysis (bias detection, quality scoring)
- Summary generation and implications analysis

### Phase 4: Digest Generation (Weeks 7-8)
**Objective**: Create and deliver personalized daily content digests

**Key Deliverables**:
- Topic clustering and importance ranking
- Markdown digest generation
- Email delivery system
- TTS audio generation

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- **API Server**: FastAPI/Flask for REST endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized schema
- **AI Processing**: Gemini API integration with fallback providers
- **Task Queue**: Redis/Celery for async processing
- **Storage**: Local file system for media and generated content

### Frontend Components
- **Web Interface**: React/Vue.js dashboard
- **Browser Extension**: Vanilla JavaScript with Manifest V3
- **Email Templates**: Responsive HTML for digests

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on home server
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and health checks
- **Backup**: Automated database and content backups

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **AI API Rate Limits**: Mitigation through multiple provider fallbacks
2. **Content Volume Scaling**: Async processing and queue management
3. **Browser Extension Store Approval**: Direct loading for development

### Project Risks
1. **Feature Scope Creep**: Strict MVP focus with future enhancement roadmap
2. **AI Processing Costs**: Budget monitoring and optimization
3. **Content Source Changes**: Robust scraping with error handling

## Success Criteria

### MVP Completion Metrics
- [ ] Successfully capture and process 25-50 content items daily
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ accuracy in political content classification
- [ ] Generate and deliver daily digests with <5 minute processing time
- [ ] Maintain 99.5% system uptime for content capture functionality

### Quality Metrics
- Content classification accuracy: >90%
- User engagement with digests: >90% open rate
- Processing performance: <30 seconds per content item
- System reliability: <1% error rate

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- IDE/Editor: VS Code with relevant extensions
- Version Control: Git with GitHub repository
- Testing: Pytest, Jest for unit and integration tests
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing

### External Services
- AI APIs: Gemini (primary), OpenAI/Anthropic (backup)
- Email Service: SMTP server configuration
- TTS Service: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or local alternatives

### Hardware Requirements
- Home server with minimum 8GB RAM, 100GB storage
- Reliable internet connection for AI API calls
- Backup storage solution

## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 2: Knowledge Retention (Months 3-4)
- Flashcard generation from processed content
- Spaced repetition system for knowledge testing
- Progress tracking and learning analytics

### Phase 3: Intelligent Browsing (Months 5-6)
- AI browsing assistant for content recommendations
- Historical content search and discovery
- Context-aware suggestions based on current browsing

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration (Months 7-8)
- Obsidian knowledge base integration
- Plugin system for custom content processing
- Advanced bias detection and fact-checking

### Phase 5: Multi-User & Sharing (Months 9-12)
- Multi-user support with individual preferences
- Content sharing and collaborative digests
- Social features and community insights

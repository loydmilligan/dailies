# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Digest Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality for creating, scheduling, and managing daily digests with customizable content.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Digest Data Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the database schema and data model for storing digest configurations, including fields for schedule, content sources, target audience, and status.
### Details:
Create a database table or document structure to represent a digest. Include fields like: `digest_id` (primary key), `name`, `description`, `schedule` (cron expression), `content_sources` (JSON array of source IDs), `target_audience` (user group or individual users), `status` (enabled/disabled), `created_at`, `updated_at`. Consider using an ORM or data access layer for database interactions.

## 2. Implement Digest Creation API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an API endpoint to create new digest configurations. This endpoint should validate input data and store the configuration in the database.
### Details:
Create a REST API endpoint (e.g., `/digests`) that accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing the digest configuration data. Validate the input data against the defined data model. Use the data access layer to store the new digest configuration in the database. Return a success response with the ID of the newly created digest.

## 3. Implement Digest Scheduling Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a background service or scheduler that retrieves enabled digest configurations from the database and schedules the digest generation process based on the defined schedule.
### Details:
Use a scheduling library (e.g., Celery, Quartz) to schedule the digest generation process. The scheduler should periodically query the database for enabled digests and schedule a task to generate each digest based on its cron expression. Handle potential errors during scheduling and logging.

## 4. Implement Digest Content Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the logic to retrieve content from the configured sources, format it, and generate the digest content.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a digest configuration as input and retrieves content from the specified sources. This may involve making API calls, querying databases, or reading files. Format the content into a readable digest format (e.g., HTML, plain text). Consider using templating engines for formatting. Implement error handling and logging for content retrieval and formatting.

## 5. Implement Digest Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the logic to deliver the generated digest content to the target audience (e.g., via email).
### Details:
Use an email sending library or service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) to send the generated digest content to the target audience. Implement error handling and logging for email sending. Consider using a queueing system to handle email sending asynchronously.

## 6. Implement Digest Management UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface for managing digest configurations, including creating, editing, enabling/disabling, and deleting digests.
### Details:
Create a UI using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. The UI should allow users to create new digests, edit existing digests, enable/disable digests, and delete digests. Use the API endpoints created in previous steps to interact with the backend. Implement validation and error handling in the UI.

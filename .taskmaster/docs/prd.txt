Product Requirements Document - Dailies Content Curation System

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dailies is a personal content curation and knowledge management system designed to solve the problem of information overload and poor retention of digital content. The system focuses on capturing, processing, and synthesizing web content—particularly US politics and news—into digestible daily summaries that enhance learning and retention.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Current Pain Points:
1. Information Overload: Consuming 25-50 pieces of content daily without proper retention
2. Passive Consumption: Reading/watching content immediately or bookmarking for later, but rarely revisiting
3. Lost Knowledge: Valuable insights and information are quickly forgotten
4. Fragmented Sources: Content comes from diverse platforms (YouTube, news sites, social media)
5. No Synthesis: Individual pieces of content are consumed in isolation without connecting themes

Target User: Tech-savvy knowledge workers and political enthusiasts who consume 25-50 digital content pieces daily and struggle with information retention.
